= S3 Restructure Lambda

This Lambda function responds to S3 bucket notifications and will copy the
objects to a new directory structure based on the rules defined in environment
variables.

toc::[]

== Building

Building and testing the Lambda can be done with cargo: `cargo test build`.

In order to deploy this in AWS Lambda, it must first be built with the `cargo
lambda` command line tool, e.g.:

[source,bash]
----
cargo lambda build --release --output-format zip
----

This will produce the file: `target/lambda/lambda-delta-optimize/bootstrap.zip`

== Infrastructure

The `deployment.tf` file contains the necessary Terraform to provision the
function, a DynamoDB table for locking, and IAM permissions. This Terraform
does *not* provision an S3 bucket to optimize.

After configuring the necessary authentication for Terraform, the following
steps can be used to provision:

[source,bash]
----
cargo lambda build --release --output-format zip
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
----

[NOTE]
====
Terraform configures the Lambda to run with the smallest amount of memory allowed. For a sizable table, this may not be sufficient for larger tables.
====

=== Environment variables

The following environment variables must be set for the function to run properly

|===
| Name | Value | Notes

| `INPUT_PATTERN`
| _required but empty by default_
| A prefix mapping that is compatible with the link:https://docs.rs/routefinder/0.5.3/routefinder/[routefinder] syntax, e.g. `some/prefix/with/:name/:filename` which makes the `name` and `filename`  parameters available in the output path.

| `OUTPUT_TEMPLATE`
| _required byt empty by default_
| A link:https://crates.io/crates/liquid[liquid] template which produces a compatible path for outputting the file into the S3 bucket.

| `OUTPUT_BUCKET`
| _optional_
| A _different_ bucket than the source bucket to execute the copy object into

| `EXCLUDE_REGEX`
| 
| optional regular expression for keys to exclude from consideration

|===

[WARNING]
====
The parameters must all be present and match in the input and output patterns.
If there are variable segments of the `INPUT_PATTERN` which must be ignored, use the
special `:ignore` parameter name to ignore that segment but still allow it to match the output pattern
====

==== Handlebars built-ins

There are a few special patterns which are available for the `OUTPUT_TEMPLATE`
to make it easy to provide more natural dynamic outputs.

|===
| Name | Value | Notes

| `year`
| Current year (UTC)
|

| `month`
| Current month (UTC)
|

| `day`
| Current day (UTC)
|

| `ds`
| Date stamp (UTC)
| Formatted with `%Y-%m-%d` e.g. `2023-08-21`

| `region`
| AWS Region defined by runtime
| The value of `AWS_REGION` or `unknown` if that variable is not available
